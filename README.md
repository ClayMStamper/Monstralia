# What is Monstralia?
Gamifying good healthy habits for kids! Children ages 2-6 take control of a baby monster avatar and teach it to make healthy choices. Using the HealthStart Foundation's curriculum Healthy Education for Youngsters (HEY), we are making a game using the Unity game engine to teach children how they can take care of their body through healthy eating and exercise.

# If you would like to contribute
All current development is on the 'unity' branch and the 'master' branch is for finalized changes.
